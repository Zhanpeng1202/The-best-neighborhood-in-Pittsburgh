~~**Proposed Pipeline**~~

~~- For the dataset that majorly contained number, such as _Arrests for Major Crimes, 1972_. We could directly use data visualization and analysis tool such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib~~

~~- For the datasets that featured with text, we think one~~ 

~~-  we plan to use large language model to anlysis the text content, for the accurate geological inforamtion, we plan to use Google API to get the coordinate and further locate the community / neighborhood.~~
