# The-best-neighborhood-in-Pittsburgh

- Come up with a team name!
- As a group, come up with some ways of defining and measuring "bestness". This doesn't have to be a serious metric, it could be whimsical or secretly "worstness.‚Äù
Each group member will be responsible for one submetric each.
- Use at least 3 datasets in your argument. The easiest way to meet this requirement is for each member to choose their own unique dataset to analyze their submetric.
- Note that if you are working in a group of 2, you still need at least 3 datasets. One of you will have to analyze two datasets, or you will have to work together on analyzing a third dataset.
- Combine your sub-metrics into a single metric as you see fit.
Create a git repository to store your data, notebooks and code.

- Introduction:
- Metrics
- The Best Neighborhood
- Conclusion

**Proposed Pipeline**
- For the dataset that majorly contained number, such as _Arrests for Major Crimes, 1972_. We could directly use data visualization and analysis tool such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib
- For the datasets that featured with text, we think one 
-  we plan to use large language model to anlysis the text content, for the accurate geological inforamtion, we plan to use Google API to get the coordinate and further locate the community / neighborhood.
